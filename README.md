# E-Commerce Flash Sale Platform - Terraform Project

## Introduction

This project uses Terraform to provision a scalable and resilient AWS infrastructure designed to handle e-commerce flash sales. It implements a microservices architecture with components for user management, product catalog, inventory management, and order processing. The infrastructure is built to handle high traffic loads, sudden spikes, and real-time data processing.

Key features include:
- Scalable Web API for flash sale operations
- Microservices architecture for different business operations
- Streaming architecture for real-time data processing
- High-performance and auto-scaling infrastructure

AWS services used in this project include:
- VPC
- EC2 with Auto Scaling
- Application Load Balancer
- RDS (MySQL)
- DynamoDB
- ElastiCache (Redis)
- S3
- CloudFront
- Lambda
- API Gateway
- Route 53
- CloudWatch
- Amazon MQ (for Apache Kafka)

## Prerequisites

- Terraform (version 1.0.0 or later)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Git

## Setup and Deployment

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yotlaire/E-Commerce-Flash-Sale-Platform.git
cd flash-sale-platform
```

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### Configure Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory and add your specific variable values:

```hcl
vpc_id = "vpc-0123abcd"
private_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]

s3_name = "example-bucket-name"
region  = "us-east-1"

```

### Apply the Terraform Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure is designed with a microservices architecture to support different business operations:

1. **Web API Layer:**
   - API Gateway for RESTful API handling product searches, item details, placing orders, and user authentication
   - Lambda functions for serverless API backend
   - CloudFront for content delivery and caching

2. **Microservices:**
   - User Service: EC2 instances with Auto Scaling
   - Product Service: EC2 instances with Auto Scaling
   - Order Service: EC2 instances with Auto Scaling
   - Inventory Service: EC2 instances with Auto Scaling

3. **Databases:**
   - RDS MySQL for relational data storage (User and Order data)
   - DynamoDB for high-performance NoSQL storage (Product and Inventory data)

4. **Caching:**
   - ElastiCache Redis cluster for caching frequently accessed data

5. **Streaming and Real-Time Processing:**
   - Amazon MQ (Apache Kafka) for real-time order processing and inventory updates

6. **Load Balancing and Auto Scaling:**
   - Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic
   - Auto Scaling groups for all services to handle traffic spikes

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting

## Additional Documentation

### Architectural Decisions

- Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Serverless components (Lambda, API Gateway) for cost-efficiency and auto-scaling
- Combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for different data needs
- Streaming architecture with Kafka for real-time order and inventory processing
- Caching layer with ElastiCache to reduce database load
- Content Delivery Network (CloudFront) for improved global performance

### Known Issues

- None at the moment

### Future Enhancements

- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Add WAF for enhanced security
- Implement more granular monitoring and alerting with CloudWatch
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
